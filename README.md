# Cooperate Server-Side

Cooperate Server-Side is a backend server application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** for the Cooperate project. The Cooperate project is a freelancing website and mobile application that aims to connect clients with freelancers. It provides a platform for clients to post projects and hire freelancers based on their skills and expertise.

This repository contains the server-side codebase for the Cooperate project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmudfathy007/cooperate-server-side.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cooperate-server-side
```

3. Install the dependencies using **Yarn**:

```bash
yarn install
```

4. Set up environment variables:

Copy the provided `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Fill in the necessary environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection URL, Cloudinary credentials, and email configuration.

**Note:**

A file called `.env.example` is provided in the project. Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`. Fill in the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file.

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

Make sure you have a MongoDB instance running and accessible, as specified in the `.env` file.

## API Documentation

For detailed information about the available APIs and their usage, please refer to the [API documentation](./API.md) file.

## Testing with Postman

To test the APIs, you can use Postman, a popular API testing tool. Follow the steps below to test the Cooperate Server-Side APIs:

1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

2. Make sure the server is running, and you have the necessary environment variables set up.

3. Send requests to the server using Postman and observe the responses.

## MVC Structure

Cooperate Server-Side follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern. The codebase is structured in a way that separates the application's concerns into three main components:

- **Models**: Contains the data models and database interactions.
- **Views**: Handles the presentation and rendering of data.
- **Controllers**: Handles the logic and serves as the intermediary between models and views.

This structure promotes code organization, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

## Seeding Data with Faker.js

To train the machine learning models, Cooperate Server-Side utilizes **Faker.js** to seed the database with realistic dummy data. This data can be used to simulate real-world scenarios and test the performance and accuracy of the machine learning algorithms.

## Socket.io for Chats and Real-Time Notifications

Cooperate Server-Side incorporates **Socket.io** to handle real-time communication between clients and the server. It provides the capability to implement chat features and send real-time notifications to connected clients. Socket.io enables seamless and interactive communication within the Cooperate platform.
